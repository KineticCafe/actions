# KineticCafe/actions

This repository holds shared public workflow actions, mostly composite actions,
used by Kinetic Commerce in its open source ([KineticCafe][]) and private
([KineticCommerce][]) repositories. Because it's shared, all tags are shared
across all workflow versions.

## Workflows

- [dependabot-automerge](tree/main/dependabot-automerge): A simple composite
  action to simplify the enabling of auto-merge of Dependabot PRs.

- [extract-changelog](tree/main/extract-changelog): A simple composite action to
  extract a version section from a changelog file.

- [resolve-ref](tree/main/resolve-ref): A simple composite action to resolve an
  input reference to a Git SHA in the running repository.
